# Third-party notices

AuroraVPN is [AGPL-3.0](LICENSE), a fork of WhiteAestherMobile (AGPL-3.0)
at revision 7ce2fcb. It embeds components under AGPL-3.0
and GPL-3.0; both are listed below with where to get their source.

AGPL-3.0 section 13 expressly permits combining an AGPL-3.0 work with a work
under GPL-3.0 into a single combined work. The AGPL-3.0 parts remain AGPL-3.0
and the GPL-3.0 parts remain GPL-3.0.

## Aether — AGPL-3.0

The native engine is vendored from `CluvexStudio/Aether` revision
`0e6f6a52`, released as `v2.0.0`. The original license and revision record are
included under `native/aether/`.

The project moved: earlier releases name `MatinSenPai/Aether`, which still
carries the revision shipped up to v1.2.1 but stops at its own `v1.3.0`. Both
hold identical objects for the tags they share.

The vendored copy is not byte-identical to that revision. It is formatted with
`cargo fmt`, its line endings are normalised to LF, and `aether/src/ffi.rs` is
omitted -- nothing here calls upstream's C API, `native/android-bridge` serves
that purpose, and the omitted file does not build against this tree.

Upstream's optional `tor` feature is also not built. The six crates behind it --
`arti-client`, `tor-chanmgr`, `tor-rtcompat`, `tokio-util`, `liblzma` and
`tracing-subscriber` -- are absent from `aether/Cargo.toml` and from the
lockfile, so none of them ships. `aether/src/tor.rs` and `aether/src/bridges.rs`
are vendored for completeness and compile to their feature-off stubs; this app
reaches tor through `info.guardianproject:tor-android` instead. See
`docs/AETHER_2_0_MERGE.md` for why.

Source for the complete original is at the revision named above.

Shipped as `libwhiteaesther_core.so`.

## FlClash core — GPL-3.0

The exit chain's Go library is built from the `core` directory of
[chen08209/FlClash](https://github.com/chen08209/FlClash), revision
`62addf738a76b1a492e19af2dbabdb6d572b9e72`.

## mihomo (Clash.Meta) — GPL-3.0

The proxy engine inside that library is
[chen08209/Clash.Meta](https://github.com/chen08209/Clash.Meta), revision
`80362fc1895dcf60b79b562896653046e0687413`, a fork of
[MetaCubeX/mihomo](https://github.com/MetaCubeX/mihomo).

**Modified by WhiteAesther.** One change, kept as a patch rather than a fork so
it is legible on its own: `native/chain/patches/0001-reality-client-version.patch`.
mihomo advertises a hardcoded REALITY client version of 1.8.2 in the ClientHello
session id, while Xray builds those bytes from its own version, so a current
Xray server rejects the handshake outright.

Shipped as `libwhiteaestherchain.so`.

### Getting the source

No GPL-3.0 component is committed to this repository. The chain's two are
fetched at build time, at the exact revisions above, by `native/chain/setup.ps1`;
psiphon-tunnel-core is resolved as a pinned maven dependency from Psiphon's own
distribution, and its source for that version is the `v2.0.41` tag of the
repository named above. Those
revisions are pinned in that script, so the source corresponding to any binary
we ship can be obtained by running it, or by fetching the revisions directly
from the upstreams named above. `native/chain/README.md` describes the build.

The GPL-3.0 text is in [licenses/GPL-3.0.txt](licenses/GPL-3.0.txt).

## psiphon-tunnel-core — GPL-3.0

The Psiphon carrier is
[Psiphon-Labs/psiphon-tunnel-core](https://github.com/Psiphon-Labs/psiphon-tunnel-core),
taken as `ca.psiphon:psiphontunnel:2.0.41` from Psiphon's own maven
distribution at
`https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Psiphon-Labs/psiphon-tunnel-core-Android-library/master`,
which corresponds to the `v2.0.41` tag of the source repository.

Unmodified. It runs in its own process (`:psiphon`) and this app talks to it
through the library's published `PsiphonTunnel` API only.

Shipped inside the APK as `libgojni.so`, which is the library that aar contains.

**The server list.** `app/src/main/assets/psiphon_server_entries.txt` is
Psiphon's public bootstrap list of server entries, fetched at build time by
`native/psiphon/setup.ps1` at the pinned revision named in that script rather
than committed here. It is data Psiphon publishes for clients to start from, not
code. Every entry carries Psiphon's signature. tunnel-core checks it only when
given the public key, which is `native/psiphon/server_entry_signature_key.txt`,
and `setup.ps1` checks the whole list with tunnel-core's own code against that
key before packaging it -- refusing any list whose entries do not all verify.

**The identifiers.** `PropagationChannelId` and `SponsorId` in
`core/PsiphonConfig.kt` are the placeholder values documented in tunnel-core's
own sample configuration, not a channel issued to this app. See
`native/psiphon/README.md`.

## tor — BSD-3-Clause, via Guardian Project

The Tor carrier is [`info.guardianproject:tor-android:0.4.9.11`](https://github.com/guardianproject/tor-android),
Guardian Project's Android build of [tor](https://gitlab.torproject.org/tpo/core/tor)
0.4.9.11 — the same build Orbot uses — together with
`info.guardianproject:jtorctl:0.4.5.7` for its control protocol. Both come from
Maven Central and neither is modified.

tor is BSD-3-Clause and both wrappers are BSD-3-Clause. Shipped inside the APK
as `libtor.so`.

## lyrebird and snowflake — BSD-3-Clause

Tor's pluggable transports, built from source at the revisions pinned in
`native/tor/setup.ps1`:

- [lyrebird](https://gitlab.torproject.org/tpo/anti-censorship/pluggable-transports/lyrebird)
  `lyrebird-0.8.1`, which provides obfs4
- [snowflake](https://gitlab.torproject.org/tpo/anti-censorship/pluggable-transports/snowflake)
  `v2.14.1`

Both are BSD-3-Clause and neither is modified. They are ordinary Go programs,
cross-compiled for Android and shipped in the APK as `liblyrebird.so` and
`libsnowflake.so` — executables named like libraries because that is the only
form Android extracts and leaves executable. Neither is committed; both are
fetched and built by `native/tor/setup.ps1` and `native/tor/build.ps1`.

## mihomo, and this combination

Both GPL-3.0 components above are combined with this AGPL-3.0 app under
AGPL-3.0 section 13, which expressly permits it. Each part keeps its own
licence; the GPL-3.0 text is in [licenses/GPL-3.0.txt](licenses/GPL-3.0.txt).

## BoringSSL Rust bindings — MIT

`boring-sys` 4.22.0 is vendored under `native/third-party/boring-sys` under its
MIT license. WhiteAesther changes only its build script to normalize `.exe`
paths from cargo-ndk on Windows; BoringSSL runtime and crypto source are not
modified. Details are in `native/third-party/README.md`.

## Vazirmatn — SIL Open Font License 1.1

The Persian interface is set in Vazirmatn v33.003 by Saber Rastikerdar, from
`rastikerdar/vazirmatn`. Four weights of its UI cut ship in `res/font-fa/`, so
they are used only where the app is set to Persian; the Latin interface keeps
Inter.

Bundled rather than fetched. A font requested at runtime is a request to a third
party naming this device, from an app whose whole purpose is not to make those.

The OFL permits redistribution inside a bundle like this one provided the font
is not sold on its own and the licence travels with it. Unmodified, and named
Vazirmatn -- the OFL's reserved-name clause forbids a modified copy keeping the
name, which is a reason not to modify it rather than a reason to rename.

The licence text is in
[licenses/OFL-1.1-Vazirmatn.txt](licenses/OFL-1.1-Vazirmatn.txt).

## Everything else

Other Kotlin, Rust, and Go dependencies retain their respective upstream
licenses. The Gradle, Cargo, and Go lockfiles identify the exact resolved
versions.
