/**
 * What the language setting has to guarantee for the switch to work.
 *
 * The failure this is written against was not in any of these values: the
 * choice saved correctly and the wrapping applied correctly, but nothing asked
 * the activity to rebuild while the user was still looking at the screen they
 * had changed it on. It took effect at the next resume, which arrived only when
 * something unrelated -- the VPN consent dialog -- paused the activity. So the
 * setting looked broken in both directions at once.
 *
 * The trigger itself is in MainActivity and needs a running activity to
 * exercise, which no unit test here can do. What is pinned below is everything
 * the trigger depends on being true.
