/**
 * What Automatic tries, and in what order.
 *
 * The bug this exists for was arithmetic, not logic: the first retry repeated
 * the transport that had just failed, so a network blocking UDP spent two full
 * endpoint scans -- about four and a half minutes -- before the framing that
 * works was tried at all. Most people close the app well before that and report
 * it as broken.
 *
 * Reflection, because the ladder lives in the service and the service cannot be
 * constructed in a test. The alternative is duplicating the sequence here, which
 * would pass while the real one drifted.
