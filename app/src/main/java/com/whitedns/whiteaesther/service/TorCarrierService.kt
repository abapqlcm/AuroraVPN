/**
 * Tor, in a process of its own.
 *
 * Unlike Psiphon this one does not have to be here -- tor is C, and a C library
 * has no runtime to collide with mihomo's. It is here anyway, for two reasons
 * that will matter more later than they do now. tor is loaded through a JNI
 * library with a process-wide lock and static state, so a crash in it takes down
 * whatever process it is in; and its pluggable transports are separate
 * executables that have to be launched and reaped by whoever owns tor, which is
 * a job for a process that can be restarted on its own.
 *
 * The shape is deliberately the same as [PsiphonService], down to the message
 * protocol: a carrier is a SOCKS5 listener on loopback and a state, and having
 * two different shapes for that would be two things to get wrong.
 *
 * [TorService] is Guardian Project's, the one Orbot uses. It is declared in this
 * app's manifest with `android:process` so that it lands here rather than in the
 * main process, and this service binds it because the port it ends up listening
 * on is readable only through its binder.
