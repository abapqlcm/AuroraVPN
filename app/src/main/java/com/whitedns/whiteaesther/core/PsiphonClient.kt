/**
 * The near side of [PsiphonService].
 *
 * Binding rather than broadcasting, for two reasons that both matter here. A
 * bound service with [Context.BIND_IMPORTANT] is raised to the importance of the
 * binder, which for us is a foreground VpnService -- an unbound background
 * process carrying a tunnel is one the system may reclaim while the screen is
 * off. And a Messenger delivers to whoever is bound now, so a state change
 * cannot be missed by a client that was not listening yet: the service answers
 * a registration with the current state rather than only the next one.
