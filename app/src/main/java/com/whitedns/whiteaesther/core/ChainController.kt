 * service and the UI both hold one and both talk to the same engine -- reading
 * the node list from the screen while the service carries traffic is the point,
 * not an accident.
 *
 * Order matters here and is the whole of Stage 2. mihomo must have its rules
 * before it is given the interface, because a mihomo with no configuration
 * routes everything DIRECT -- and a DIRECT route from this process is excluded
 * from the interface, so it would leave in the clear. Attaching last means
