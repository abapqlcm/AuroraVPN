//! Loads the Go library that carries mihomo, and gives Kotlin a way to drive it.
//!
//! # Why the chain lives behind this bridge rather than beside it
//!
//! The exit chain needs a second engine, and mihomo is Go. Go supports one
//! runtime per process, so there can be exactly one `-buildmode=c-shared`
//! library: two of them export the same runtime symbols into a single linker
//! namespace, and a call binding to the wrong copy enters a runtime that has
//! never heard of the calling goroutine. This crate is Rust, so Rust plus that
//! one Go library is fine.
//!
//! It is loaded with `dlopen` rather than linked, so the chain is optional. A
//! build that does not ship the library still runs; the chain simply reports
//! itself unavailable instead of the app failing to start.
//!
//! # The contract
//!
//! The Go side calls back through five function pointers it expects the host to
//! fill in. Ownership across that boundary is not symmetric, and getting it
//! wrong is a double free:
//!
//! - strings we pass in are freed by us, through `free_string`, once Go has
//!   copied them
//! - the string Go passes to `result` belongs to Go, which frees it when
//!   `result` returns, so it must be copied rather than taken
//! - the opaque callback handle is ours, and Go says when to drop it through
//!   `release_object`
//!
//! `protect` is the important one. mihomo calls it for every socket it opens,
//! and it has to reach `VpnService.protect()`. Without that, the tun's default
//! route pulls mihomo's own connections back into the tunnel it is building.
